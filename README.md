# GPT3 Website Clone

I created this repository to learn coding in React. What better way to learn than by taking something that already exists and trying to recreate it?


## Functionality

- A nice-looking and dynamic website.
- A pretty aesthetic navbar.
- Everything that you can find on the normal GPT3 website :)
